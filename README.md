# ProfessionalPortfolio

A professional portfolio outline for JASON MA

Consists of two pages:
* Index.html
* Projects.html

Functionalities:

NAV Bar takes  you to either
*Homepage
*LinkedIn
*Projects
*Github

Banner on main page has arrows on either side, allows you to "toggle" which image is used to display on main.
Projects now has multiple assignments, prioritizes the top 3.

Need to find a way to implement arrow functions
