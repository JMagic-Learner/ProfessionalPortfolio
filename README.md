## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Professional Portfolio - Serverside Edition.
              
Description:
This application could've been a simple hardcoded HTML layout filled with generic CSS and JS files. However, I decided to be a lunatic and something completely unnecessary; migrating this code to the server based. 90% of the functionality from the original Professional Portfolio is still here, however, I decided to add some design choices/sacrifices             
          
Coding Process
First, we take inspiration from Project 2 - Playlistify. Second, we plan out the migration from raw - html to a view based Handlebar application. I had to choose which original elements to parse out into different pages, and which details would be fed through to {{{Body}}

# Usage
              
This is nothing more than a demonstration of how raw HTML files can be translated into a dynamic server based application
